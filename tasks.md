	* Which month do people crash the most?

2. **How old was the oldest driver?** 
	* Why is this most likely not correct? Do you have possible explanation?

3. **Create a visualisation showing the average vehicle age grouped by year of the accident**
	* Save the visualization and add it to the dashboard

4. **Create a vertical bar chart showing number of injuries grouped by year**
	* Compare it against average injuries grouped by year. What does this difference indicate?
	* Save the visualization and add it to the dashboard

5. **What is the percentage of male drivers?**

6. **How many men have crashed in a roundabout on a Monday between 08.00-08.59?**

7. **Create a tag cloud showing the surface conditions**
	* Save the visualization and add it to the dashboard

8. **Find the sum of seriously injured grouped by speed limit**
	* Compare this with number of accidents grouped by speed limit

9. **Bonus: Find the accident of Petter Northug in discover**

When you have finished all the tasks, try to create more visualizations and add it to the dashboard. Click on a visualization (for example the male drivers in the pie chart), and see how the rest of the visualizations are filtered. 

If you like to write queries directly to Elasticsearch, you can do that through the console on **Dev Tools**
